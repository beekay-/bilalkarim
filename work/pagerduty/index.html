        <p class="no-padding">Designing an Analytics product can be a complex task compared to designing pages with simple forms or even an image gallery. There is no right or ideal path&mdash;it all depends on the level of information the user is looking for. Some users want additional details while others may only care about high-level metrics. But insights must be provided at the speed of thought in order to curb uncertainty. This is why I developed certain dashboard principles for us to follow. For example, user exploration must be limited to a certain extent, otherwise users could end up with information paralysis where they’re continually searching for every data correlation possible. This is not ideal for majority of the users, as ultimately they want to make business decisions from these data. Instead, the goal of a dashboard should be effective communication&mdash;with the most important information being at the top. At first glance, users should be able to spot trends, gather insights, and determine the next steps that they may need to take. Visually, red and green should only be used to indicate negative and positive trends. Using them incorrectly can be dangerous as they have very powerful meanings. Neutral colours like grey, blue, and purple are best for actual visualization of the data. Legends must be visible on charts, numeric and text labels must be clear and legible, and aligned to their respective data table formats (e.g., right-align for numbers, left-align for strings).</p>

        <p class="no-padding">Aside from designing Intelligent Dashboards from scratch, I later started supporting an existing feature of PagerDuty Analytics&mdash;known as Operational Reviews&mdash;which represented similar yet static information to the user regarding team health, service performance, and business impact. Working on this feature led to a realization of how broken the overall user experience is for PagerDuty Analytics. This was also evident from user interviews, where questions like “How is this feature different from X?” or “Why does metric X vary and exist in two different areas of PagerDuty Analytics?”</p>

    <div class="section wrapper">
        <p class="no-padding">With more user interviews, it became clearer that this is indeed a big problem. Furthermore, when users requested for additional insights or data, they would mostly be around better understanding team health, service performance, and business impact. Given that the user experience of PagerDuty Analytics was so fragmented, I started working on a “metrics map” that would roughly showcase the information architecture, and become the foundation of a blue sky design exercise.</p>

        <p class="no-padding">After convincing my Product Manager, I started on this blue sky design exercise to unify the user experience of PagerDuty Analytics&mdash;keeping team health, service performance, and business impact from the metrics map at its core. My goal was to not only showcase what the future of the product could look like, but also get internal Product + Engineering teams as well as users excited about its possibilities.</p>

Allowing users to customize the PagerDuty app icon is just the beginning.</p>

                <h1><strong>Challenges</strong></h1>
            </div>
            <p class="no-bottom-padding"><span class="green-grd-text"><strong>Technological constraints.</strong></span> The biggest challenge working on PagerDuty Analytics, specifically with Intelligent Dashboards, was dealing with technological constraints. For example, the front-end of the product was powered by a BI tool known as Periscope. That severely limited the possibilities of the overall user experience. As a designer, it was critical to understand Periscope’s limitations in order to design an experience around or with them. Additionally, from a user experience point-of-view, the level of data exploration was also important as previously mentioned. The “drill down” functionality of charts needed to be limited, otherwise the user flow could get confusing very quickly. How much further should the user be allowed to go when drilling down into charts and related data? How do you indicate the level of navigational hierarchy to the user? How would this interaction look and function across multiple charts? The answers depended on the story being told with the data.</p>

<!-- Fear is sort of an odd thing. When I was in residency my first solo procedure was a spinal surgery on a sixteen year old kid, a girl. And at the end, after thirteen hours, I was closing her up and I... I accidentally ripped her dural sac, shredded the base of the spine where all the nerves come together, membrane as thin as tissue. And so it ripped open and the nerves just spilled out of her like angel hair pasta, spinal fluid flowing out of her and I... and the terror was just so crazy. So real. And I knew I had to deal with it. So I just made a choice. I'd let the fear in, let it take over, let it do its thing, but only for five seconds, that's all I was going to give it. So I started to count: one, two, three, four, five. Then it was gone. I went back to work, sewed her up and she was fine. — Jack Shepard (LOST, 2004) -->
